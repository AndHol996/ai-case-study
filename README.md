# Upcoming Business Intelligence Company: AlphaSense

## Overview: The When, Why, Who, and How of their origin <br>
AlphaSense is a company founded in 2011 by Jack Kokko and Raj Neervannan. It started by advancing companies' research in business output. On their About Us page for AlphaSense they state that: <br>
>[They] sought to solve this problem by launching AlphaSense, a new type of search engine that leverages machine learning and natural language processing technology to enable professionals to cut through the noise and easily extract insights from thousands of sources and billions of data points.’ [1] <br>
From January 2013 to June 2024, the company has had a total of 12 funding rounds amassing $1.39 Billion coming from multiple financial institutions like Viking Global Investors, Goldman Sachs, and CapitalG with total of 31 investors. [2] <br>
## Business Activities
It is a financial research platform that can assist in the decision-making for asset management, private equity, and investment banking and research into investment opportunities and venture capital [3]. The major clientele of AlphaSense is “85% of the S&P 100, 80% of top asset management firms, [and] 80% of the top consultancies” [4]. The investors, which are a part of the stated percentiles, utilize the services offered by AlphaSense [5]. From the partnerships with investors comes a unique set of data that gives an edge against competitors [5].  
After looking through the links on the Compare page of AlphaSense, one can see the major difference between them and their competition is the limited research access and lack of generative AI capabilities as seen with CB Insights [7] or if they utilize AI like with Hebbia, the competition is still limited from access to sources with broker research and can only access public sources [8]. In the sphere of AI utilization, AlphaSense uses natural language processing that has features of “synonym recognition and sentiment analysis” [9] that improve the research process. Furthermore, they offer generative AI that can provide company summaries and comparisons between competitors [9] within a fraction of the time that would be required if done by hand. The combination of AI tools and a larger set of data allows AlphaSense to dominate the business intelligence market.



## Landscape

As stated before, AlphaSense is in the field of finances, and from what has been previously discussed in this case study AlphaSense is at the forefront of major innovation in the financial sector with artificial intelligence. The other major companies in sector of business intelligence are Bloomberg Terminal, CB Insights, Klue, Koyfin, GLG, Pitchbook, and Kompyte, along with many others that AlphaSense has offered in-depth comparisons on their website [6].

## Results
The impact so far has been the increased efficiency of outputting various financial summaries, being able to uncover trends that were not seen within charts via optical character recognition which then can improve data modeling and analysis, and an increase in the value of the expansive analyst research that AlphaSense has access to [10].
The core metrics to measure success in business intelligence fall under four metrics: User Adoption, Data Usage, Infrastructure, and Business Metrics [11]. In short, these are how much the is program being used, how much data is accessible and worthwhile, how efficiently is that data being processed into a usable form for companies, and how well that processed data helps the clientele. The fact that a majority of the S&P 100, top asset management firms, and top consultancy firms [4] utilize AlphaSense’s services showcases its success and how it is a powerful competitor within the business intelligence field of finances.


## Recommendations
One recommendation I have for AlphaSense is to create an investment application to offer the services to the public since they seem to have only companies as customers, and one needs a business email to sign up for their services. This would extend their clientele to the public, which could increase revenue and popularity. This would require additional databases, a new application, and an API to communicate to and from their databases and new customers. Additional technology would be necessary to keep their existing programs reliable and at the efficient rate that they advertise.
